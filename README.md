# ðŸ§  PageHunt â€“ Page Replacement Algorithm Visualizer

PageHunt is an **interactive visualizer** that demonstrates how different page replacement algorithms manage memory.  
It helps you understand the working of **FIFO**, **LRU**, and **Optimal** algorithms with step-by-step visualizations and page fault tracking.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- ðŸ”„ Supports **FIFO**, **LRU**, and **Optimal** page replacement algorithms
- ðŸŽ¯ Tracks the number of **page faults** for each algorithm
- ðŸ’¡ Interactive interface for entering:
  - Page reference string
  - Frame size
- ðŸ“Š Visual representation of memory frames and page hits/faults

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a browser and basic web setup (HTML/CSS/JS) ready.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
